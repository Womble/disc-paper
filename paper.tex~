Title : 

Introduction: 
1. description of what has been done so far on the modeling and radiative transfer of disks (this includes also more evolved disks -- Visser et al., Walsh et al., Aikawa et al. ..)
2. focus on the young disks (work done by Machida et al., Dapp, Basu & Kunz 2012, .. for their formation; work by Boley et al. on the physical evolution ; Ilee et al. for chemistry) 
3. previous attempts to observe these young disks: (a) simulations (Cossins et al. 2010); (b) observations: Fuente et al. 2010 (AB Aur); Jorgensen & van Dishoeck (H2^{18}O and the HDO/H2O ratio); Pineda et al. (2012); other papers talking about "hot corinos" (Bottinelli et al. ....)

Model Description

Briefly:
-describe the envelope structure (pre-stellar core)
-describe the physical structure of the disk (density and temperature) -- one figure showing the physical structure and the kinematics (2-panels figure)
-describe the chemistry  - refer to Ilee et al.
which have been taken as input to the rad transf (RT) code 
-describe the RT used (LIME) 
-how did you build the grid  (if this is too long it can go in an appendix)  - figure with the grid

Model Results
Figures showing the RT results in a few molecules/transitions (CO, HCO+, HCN, OCS, H2CO, NH3 --- maybe H2O,H2^{18}O [to try first])  
Figure showing different inclinations  
Figure showing different transitions of the same molecule (e.g. CO(1-0), ...(7-6) , OCS,  H2CO ) for same inclination but in different disks (Boley et al. and the smooth disk)

Simulations of ALMA observations
