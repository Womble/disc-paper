\section{Introduction}

1. description of what has been done so far on the modelling and radiative transfer of disks (this includes also more evolved disks -- Visser et al., Walsh et al., Aikawa et al. ..)
2. focus on the young disks (work done by Machida et al., Dapp, Basu \& Kunz 2012, .. for their formation; work by Boley et al. on the physical evolution ; Ilee et al. for chemistry) 
3. previous attempts to observe these young disks: (a) simulations (Cossins et al. 2010); (b) observations: Fuente et al. 2010 (AB Aur); Jorgensen \& van Dishoeck (H$_2^{18}$O and the HDO/H2O ratio); Pineda et al. (2012); other papers talking about "hot corinos" (Bottinelli et al. ....)

\section{Description of the Model}

%-describe the envelope structure (pre-stellar core)
The model used to simulate the emission from a young protoplanetary disc is a hybrid model created from hydrodynamical models of an infalling prestellar core and a gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disc. The prestellar core model is based upon the model of Keto \& Caselli (2010). This describes an infalling pre-stellar core, with densities temperatures and velocities given by the model of the collapse of a 10 solar mass Bonnor-Ebert sphere and provides a match to line profiles seen in the pre-stellar core L1544. Some slight modification due to the addition of Oxygen lines (Keto et al 2012 in prep) have been been added to this model resulting in a slight decrease in the peak infall velocity. This prestellar core model extends from 80$\,$au out to 10,000$\,$AU. The model is a 1D spherically symmetric model with inward motions (see figure \ref{l1544model}).\newline

%-describe the physical structure of the disk (density and temperature) -- one figure showing the physical structure and the kinematics (2-panels figure)
At radii less than 80$\,$au the physical structure is given by the hydrodynamic model described in Ilee et al. (2011), based on the work of Boley(2007), and Boley(2009). This model describes a 0.39$\,\rm{M}_\odot$ self-gravitating disc featuring prominent spiral arms. H$_2$ number densities in the disc range from 10$^{10}$-10$^{19}\,\rm{m}^{-3}$, and temperatures range from 30-400 K (figure \ref{rhoT}). The dust and gas temperatures in the disc are assumed to be in equilibrium. The model is sampled over a regular grid of size 256$\times$256$\times$64 with spatial resolution of 0.5$\,$au in x, y and z. The majority of the mass lies in the mid-plane of the disc. For the models using a smoothed disc the same physical and chemical model is used but with the temperature, density and abundance averaged in $\phi$. The gas/dust mass ratio was assumed to be 1/100 throughout both sections model and the opacities were given by the model of dust grains with thick icy mantles and 10$^6\,$yr coagulation from Ossenkopf and Henning (1994)\newline

%-describe the chemistry  - refer to Ilee et al. which have been taken as input to the rad transfer (RT) code
Chemical abundances in the disc were taken from Ilee et. al (2011) which followed the changes of chemical abundances of trace particles moving through the disc as it evolved. The abundances of 125 species related by 1334 reactions were followed through the time evolution of the disc. These abundances were interpolated onto a 51$^3$ grid covering the disc with cells of size 2.2$\times$2.2$\times$0.22$\,$au. Abundances in the envelope model were as follows:\newline

(tableify this?)\newline
HCO$^+$: as the H2O profile from Caselli (2012, submitted) scaled so that the maximum abundance is 10$^{-8}$\newline
HNO: constant abundance of 5$\times$10${-11}$\newline
HCS$^+$: 10$^{-11}$\newline
OCS: constant abundance of 10$^{-9}$\newline
H$_2$CO: 1.5$\times$10$^{-9}$ decreased by a factor of 40 at radii less than 8250au (Young et al 2004)\newline
CS:  3$\times$10$^{-9}$ decreased by a factor of 10,000 at radii less than 6700au (Tafalla, santiago-garcia and myers 2006)\newline
CO: as the H2O profile from Caselli (2012, submitted) scaled so that the maximum abundance is CO maximum\newline


%-describe the RT used (LIME) 
LIME (Brinch 2011), the radiative transfer program used, calculates line intensities based on a weighted sample of randomly chosen points in a continuous 3d model. The method of selecting these points is given in the griding section. At each of these points the density of the main collision partner (in this case H$_2$), gas and dust temperatures, velocity, molecular abundances and turbulent velocity and taken from the model. These points are then smoothed by Lloyds algorithm (Lloyd 1982) in order to minimise the variation in distance between points whilst keeping the same underlying distribution. These points are then connected by Delaunay triangulation and it is down these paths that photons are restricted to propagating (figures \ref{grid}). The levels of molecules in question are then  calculated at each of these points from collisional and radiative (de)excitation and the local radiation field is calculated. This is repeated 20 times with the populations of each level converging towards a single value.\newline

 \includegraphics[width=84mm]{Figures/model/Lime_grid3.png}
 \label{grid}
 \caption{A plot of the points selected by the griding process and the paths down which photons can propagate overlaid on a smoothed density model. The points are more concentrated at small radii and in the densest regions.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=84mm]{Figures/model/lime_points_rz2.png}
 \label{points}
 \caption{A plot of the positions of the points selected to sample the model}
\end{figure}

In order to construct the grid, points are randomly selected from the volume being simulated then compared against a reference point. Grid points are selected at random in cylindrical co-ordinates, linearly spaced in z and $\phi$ and logarithmically spaced in r. For each point to be selected a random number $\alpha$ is drawn from the semi-open set [0,$\,$1) as a threshold. After selection of random co-ordinates the Hydrogen density and molecular density at the point (n and m) are compared against the densities of a reference point on the inner edge of the disc (n$_0$ and m$_0$). If $\alpha<\left( \frac{n}{n_0} \right)^{0.3}$ or $\alpha< \left( \frac{m}{m_0} \right)^{0.3}$ then the point is selected for use, if not then another r, $\phi$, z co-ordinate is selected. The weighting function and griding functions were selected empirically to sample both the all scales while ensuring the majority of the points went into the inner disc which is the region of interest. 20\% of these points are forced to be at radii greater than $\sqrt{R_{min}R_{max}}$ (where $R_{min}$ and $R_{max}$ are the inner and outer radius of the model) in order to stop too many of the selecected points clustering in the high density disc and leaving the envelope undersampled. In addiation to this method of selection 5\% of the points are linearly distributed in x, y and z with no bias with regards to density or abundance. This provides a minimum level of sampling for the large low density regions in the outer parts of the simulated volume. See figure \ref{points} for example of the points distribution in r, z. \newline

\section{Model Results}

%Figures showing the RT results in a few molecules/transitions (CO, HCO$^+$, HCN, OCS, H2CO, NH3 --- maybe H2O,H2$^{18}$O [to try first])
The results of these simulations for the molecules OCS, HCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and isotopologues of CO are shown here, other molecules simulated but not shown include HCN, HNC, HNO, HCS$^+$ and  CS.
For the purpose of simulating observations the model was placed at roughly the distance of nearby low-mass star forming regions (100$\,$pc) and is inclined 30$^\circ$ to edge on. From these observations integrated intensity, intensity weighted velocity and position velocity diagrams through the centre of the model were created.
The simulations done are focused upon frequencies within ALMA band 7, selected to give the best trade off between resolution and sensitivity for early ALMA science.
(Note the moment 1 and 0 maps were created by integrating between -12.5 to -0.5 km$\,$s$^{-1}$ and +0.5 to +12.5 km$\,$s$^{-1}$ to avoid being dominated by the contribution from the envelope, this can be seen in some PV diagrams as the strong absorption feature at all positions around zero velocity, moment 1 maps are shown with a cutoff of 1/1000 of the peak emission/absorption value)\newline

\end{figure}

Figures 6,7 and 8 show synthetic images of the CO J=3-2 line at 345.8$\,$GHz. As the upper level for this line is at 33$\,$K above the ground state this transition should be excited through out disc. given the large and uniform nature of the abundance of CO in the disc this line will be optically thick and this is only mapping the outer regions of the disc. In common with most transitions simulated, the line is seen almost exclusively in absorption of the disc continuum. The region of emission in the centre is where there is no continuum background to be absorbed.  Some indications of spiral structure can be seen but are indistinct. ***not sure how useful these are, might be worth cutting them?***\newline

The OCS lines in alma band 7 (22-21 through 30-29) with upper energy levels between 161 and 271 K above the ground state provide a way to trace hot shocked gas in spiral arms without resolving structure. Figures \ref{OCS_mom0} \& \ref{smoothOCS_mom0} show the integrated intensity of the OCS J=28-27 line in the model described previously and one where the disc section of the model is an axis-symmetric model created by taking the azimuthal average of density, temperature and molecular abundance. The order of magnitude difference in the line intensity provides a method to detect hot dense gas without being able to resolve the spiral structure spatially.\newline

More complex molecules such as H$_2$CO with many closely spaced spectral lines can be used to gain an estimate on the temperature of a region. 

(figure of temperature as a function of line ratio for 2 sets of formaldehyde lines and map of derived temperature, talk to P about this. This doesn't seem doable with the lines around 1mm for alma)\newline

Some molecules such as HCO$^+$ trace only the outer regions of the disc (ref ilee 2011) and so can be used to look at the extended velocity and physical structure. In these colder less dense regions we see the molecular lines in emission rather than absorption \newline

In all the simulations except HCO$^+$ we see molecular lines in absorption throughout the majority of the disc and in some cases a small amount of emission towards the centre, where the inclination of the disc allows us the view the low density but moderate temperature region inside the inner edge of the spiral structures.\newline

\section{Discussion}

In this paper we have performed radiative transfer simulations of a hybrid model comprising a 0.4$\, M_\odot$ self gravitating disc with radius 64$\,AU$ showing spiral density waves, surrounded by an envelope simulated as a collapsing 10$\,M_\odot$ BE-sphere. CASA simulations show that at a distance of 100$\,pc$ both spatial resolution of the spirals in such a disc and extraction of kinematic and temperature from molecular lines are possible in ALMA band 7. Our simulations show that many  molecular species are predominantly seen in absorption towards the centre of  self-gravitating protoplanetary discs.\newline
The quiescent nature of the envelope around such discs only obscures them within $\pm\,0.5 km\,s^{-1}$.\newline
Hot, shocked gas can be detected in such a disc without resolving it by observing OCS transitions between 26-27 to 30-29.\newline
Mention that dust and gas are assumed to be in temperature equilibrium if they aren't and dust is significantly cooler then transitions may not show up in absorption. atm spirals shock heat the mid-plane layer and the colder more diffuse gas absorbs the continuum from it (need to ask Aaron whether this is the case, the narrow mid-plane is much hotter than the rest but should check that this is due to shock heating, though with there being no accretion or irradiation i don't see what else it could be)\newline
note that the disc mass is on the high end for early discs\newline
rotation curves can be gathered from these observations even with spiral structure\newline

%
%(This appendix was not part of the original paper by
%A.V.~Raveendran and is included here just for illustrative
%purposes. The references are not relevant to the text of the
%appendix, they are references from the bibliography used to
%illustrate text before and after citations.)
%
%Spectroscopic observations of bright quasars show that the mean
%number density of Ly$\alpha$ forest lines, which satisfy certain
%criteria, evolves like $\rmn{d}N/\rmn{d}z=A(1+z)^\gamma$, where
%$A$ and~$\gamma$ are two constants.  Given the above intrinsic
%line distribution we examine the probability of finding large gaps
%in the Ly$\alpha$ forests.  We concentrate here only on the
%statistics and neglect all observational complications such as the
%line blending effect \citep[see][for example]{b11}.
%
%Suppose we have observed a Ly$\alpha$ forest between redshifts $z_1$
%and~$z_2$ and found $N-1$ lines.  For high-redshift quasars $z_2$~is
%usually the emission redshift $z_{\rmn{em}}$ and $z_1$ is set to
%$(\lambda_{\rmn{Ly}\beta}/\lambda_{\rmn{Ly}\alpha})(1+z_{\rmn{em}})=0.844
%(1+z_{\rmn{em}})$ to avoid contamination by Ly$\beta$ lines.  We
%want to know whether the largest gaps observed in the forest are
%significantly inconsistent with the above line distribution.  To do
%this we introduce a new variable~$x$:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%x={(1+z)^{\gamma+1}-(1+z_1)^{\gamma+1} \over
%     (1+z_2)^{\gamma+1}-(1+z_1)^{\gamma+1}}.
%\end{equation}
%%
%$x$ varies from 0 to 1.  We then have $\rmn{d}N/\rmn{d}x=\lambda$, where $\lambda$
%is the mean number of lines between $z_1$ and $z_2$ and is given by
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\lambda\equiv{A[(1+z_2)^{\gamma+1}-(1+z_1)^{\gamma+1}]\over\gamma+1}.
%\end{equation}
%%
%This means that the Ly$\alpha$ forest lines are uniformly
%distributed in~$x$. The probability of finding $N-1$ lines between $z_1$
%and~$z_2$, $P_{N-1}$, is assumed to be the Poisson distribution.
